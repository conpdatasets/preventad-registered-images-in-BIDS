The PREVENT-AD (Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel Treatments for
Alzheimer Disease) cohort is composed of cognitively healthy participants over 55
years old, at risk of developing Alzheimer Disease (AD) as their parents and/or
siblings were/are affected by the disease. These ‘at-risk’ participants have been
followed for a naturalistic study of the pre-symptomatic phase of AD since 2011
using multi-modal measurements of various disease indicators. Two clinical trials
intended to test pharmaco-preventive agents have also been conducted.

The open PREVENT-AD dataset includes longitudinal data from 308  
participants either in the observational cohort or from INTREPAD, the main clinical
trial. INTREPAD (Investigation of Naproxen as a TREatment for Prevention of
Alzheimer’s Disease) is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial of
naproxen sodium 220 mg or placebo twice daily.

Available data includes structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
and basic demographics (age at MRI, Sex, Study language, Handedness).

A few important notes regarding the dataset:
  - both the Siemens 12-channel and 32-channel coils were used to acquire the images
    in this dataset. This information is available in the JSON file of
    each image.
  - some sessions included a pause for the participant. In order to clarify which
    T1w image should be used with which sequence, we added an 'IntendedFor' field
    in all T1w JSON file so that the correct T1w can be used for co-registration
    with the other sequences.
